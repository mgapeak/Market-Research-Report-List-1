<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gel Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Evaporation (Air-Drying) Systems</li><li>Vacuum Drying Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gel dryer market comprises two main types: passive evaporation (air-drying) systems and vacuum drying systems. Passive evaporation systems utilize ambient air to facilitate moisture removal from gel materials, making them suitable for heat-sensitive applications. In contrast, vacuum drying systems operate under reduced pressure, allowing for faster drying at lower temperatures, which minimizes the risk of thermal degradation. Both methods are essential for optimizing the drying process, with specific applications in pharmaceuticals, food processing, and material science.</p></p>
