<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-end ICU ventilators market is categorized into invasive and non-invasive ventilation types. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver oxygen directly to the lungs, suitable for patients with severe respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, employs masks or nasal prongs to provide respiratory support without intubation, making it ideal for patients with moderate respiratory distress. Each type plays a crucial role in managing critically ill patients in intensive care settings.</p></p>
